- security
-- use fuse to obviate true name and location of php files
---- fuse(name) --> dbhold(name) === include 'truename and location'
-- use php envelope to hold html forms
-- all parameters passed via database EXCEPT (SID, to, back, {msg})
--- to is url of receiving page
--- msg is any {optional} error message sent
--- back is url to goto after process OR on error (eg becomes 'to')

- tests
- larry's forms will not pass parameters when enveloped in a php form
-- simple forms will pass parameters
IE still need simple wysiwyg editor
